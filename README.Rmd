# did2s

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of did2s is to estimate TWFE models without running into the problem of staggered treatment adoption. 

## Installation

You can install did2s from github with:

``` r
devtools::install_github("kylebutts/did2s")
```

## Two-stage Difference-in-differences [@Gardner_2021]

Researchers often want to estimate either a static TWFE model,

<img src="man/figures/twfe.png" width="400px" height="100%">

where $\mu_i$ are unit fixed effects, $\mu_t$ are time fixed effects, and $D$ <sub>it</sub> is an indicator for receiving treatment, or an event-study TWFE model

<img src="man/figures/es.png" width="450px" height="100%">

where $D$ <sub>it</sub><sup>k</sup> are lag/leads of treatment (k periods from initial treatment date). Sometimes researches use variants of this model where they bin or drop leads and lags.

However, running OLS to estimate either model has been shown to not recover an average treatment effect and has the potential to be severely misleading in cases of treatment effect heterogeneity [@Borusyak_Jaravel_Spiess_2021; @Callaway_SantAnna_2018; @deChaisemartin_DHaultfoeuille_2019; @Goodman-Bacon_2018; @Sun_Abraham_2020]. 

One way of thinking about this problem is through the FWL theorem. When estimating the unit and time fixed effects, you create a residualized $\tilde{y}$ <sub>it</sub> which is commonly said to be "the outcome variable after removing time shocks and fixed units characteristics", but you also create a residulaized $\tilde{D}$ <sub>it</sub> or $\tilde{D}$ <sub>it</sub><sup>k</sup>. To simplify the literature, this residualized treatment indicators is what creates the problem of interpreting $\tau$ or $\tau^k$, especially when treatment effects are heterogeneous.

That's where @Gardner_2021 comes in. What Gardner does to fix the problem is quite simple: estimate $\mu_i$ and $\mu_t$ seperately so you don't residualize the treatment indicators. In the absence of treatment, the TWFE model gives you a model for (potentially unobserved) untreated outcomes 

<img src="man/figures/twfe_count.png" width="350px" height="100%">

Therefore, if you can ***consistently*** estimate $y$ <sub>it</sub> $(0)$, you can impute the untreated outcome and remove that from the observed outcome $y$ <sub>it</sub>. The value of $y$ <sub>it</sub> $ - \hat{y}$ <sub>it</sub> $(0)$ should be close to zero for control units and should be close to $\tau$ <sub>it</sub> for treated observations. Then, regressing $y$ <sub>it</sub> $ - \hat{y}$ <sub>it</sub> $(0)$ on the treatment variables should give unbiased estimates of treatment effects (either static or dynamic/event-study). This is the same logic as the new paper @Borusyak_Jaravel_Spiess_2021

The steps of the two-step estimator are:

1. First estimate $\mu_i$ and $\mu_t$ using untreated/not-yet-treated observations, i.e. the subsample with $D$ <sub>it</sub> $=0$. Residualize outcomes:

<img src="man/figures/resid.png" width="350px" height="100%">

2. Regress $\tilde{y}$ <sub>it</sub> on $D$ <sub>it</sub> or $D$ <sub>it</sub><sup>k</sup>'s to estimate the treatment effect $\tau$ or $\tau^k$'s.

Some notes:

### Standard Errors

First, the standard errors on $\tau$ or $\tau^k$'s will be incorrect as the dependent variable is itself an estimate. This is referred to the generated regressor problem in econometrics parlance. Therefore, @Gardner_2021 has developed a GMM estimator that will give asymptotically correct standard errors. Details are left to the paper, but are implemented in the R package

### Anticipation

Second, this procedure works so long as $\mu_i$ and $\mu_t$ are ***consistently*** estimated. The key is to use only untreated/not-yet-treated observations to estimate the fixed effects. For example, if you used observations with $D$ <sub>it</sub> $ = 1$, you would attribute treatment effects $\tau$ as "fixed characteristics" and would combine $\mu_i$ with the treatment effects.

The fixed effects could be biased/inconsistent if there are anticipation effects, i.e. units respond before treatment starts. The fix is fairly simple, simply "shift" treatment date earlier by as many years as you suspect anticipation to occur (e.g. 2 years before treatment starts) and estimate on the subsample where the shifted treatment equals zero. The R package allows you to specify the variable $D$ <sub>it</sub>, if you suspect anticipation, provide the shifted variable to this option.

### Covariates

This method works with pre-determined covariates as well. Augment the above step 1. to include $X_i$ and remove that from $y$ <sub>it</sub> along with the fixed effects to get $\tilde{y}$ <sub>it</sub>. 

## Stata Package

I have created an R package with the help of John Gardner to estimate the two-stage procedure. To install the package, run the following:

``` stata
net install did2s, from("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kylebutts/did2s_stata/main/ado/")
* ssc install did2s
```

To view the documentation, type `help did2s` into the console.


```{stata}

********************************************************************************
* Static
********************************************************************************

use data/df_het.dta
	
* Manually (note standard errors are off)
qui reg dep_var i.state i.year if treat == 0
predict adj, residuals
reg adj i.treat, vce(cluster state)


* With did2s correction	
did2s dep_var, first_stage(i.state i.year) treat_formula(i.treat) treat_var(treat) vce(cluster state)


```

You can also do event-study by changing the `treat_formula`

```{stata}
use data/df_het.dta

* can't have negatives in factor variable
gen rel_year_shift = rel_year + 20
did2s dep_var, first_stage(i.state i.year) treat_formula(i.rel_year_shift) treat_var(treat) vce(cluster state)
```


This method works with pre-determined covariates as well!
